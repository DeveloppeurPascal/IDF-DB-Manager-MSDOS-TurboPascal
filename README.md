# IDF DB Manager - Turbo Pascal - MS-Dos - 1991

[Cette page en fran√ßais.](LISEZMOI.md)

Database manager developed with [Turbo Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Vision) under [Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal) in 1991 and 1992.

The source codes provided are the latest version. You won't be able to recompile them unless you have a version of Turbo Pascal or Borland Pascal, since the Turbo Vision units used are not public.

The compiled 8-bit version of the program is supplied. It can be used under MS-Dos or early versions of Windows.

A more modern version of the program will one day be developed to open archives (old IDF format databases or tables still out there or at least on my hard disks).
